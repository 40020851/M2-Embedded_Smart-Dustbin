# Requirements
In this project, I have designed a simple system called Smart Dustbin using Atmega328, Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo Motor, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open itself upon detection of human hand.

## Introduction
In this project, I will show you How to Make a Smart Dustbin using Atmega328, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open when you approach with trash. The other important components used to make this Smart Dustbin are an HC-04 Ultrasonic Sensor and an SG90 TowerPro Servo Motor.Dustbins (or Garbage bins, Trash Cans, whatever you call them) are small plastic (or metal) containers that are used to store trash (or waste) on a temporary basis. They are often used in homes, offices, streets, parks etc. to collect the waste.
## Research
- Smart Dustbin as its name represents it works smartly or we can say that it is an automatic dustbin.
- It works like when you will come in front of this dustbin it will open automatically with the help of a servo motor. so there is some sensor work to detect the object in front of the dustbin.
- Smart Bins help to create a cleaner, safer, more hygienic environment and enhanced operational efficiency while reducing management costs, resources, and road-side emissions.
- The Smart Bin is ideal for busy locations such as campuses, theme parks, airports, railway stations, and shopping malls.
- Usually, it is a common practice to use separate bins for collecting wet or dry, recyclable or non-recyclable waste.
- The main concept behind the Smart Dustbin using atmega328 project is Object Detection.
## Features
- A smart system positioned inside the container uses sensors, image recognition and artificial intelligence to do this.
- They consist of sensors, which work as real-time indicators to determine if the bins are full or not, and help to customise the waste collection schedule accordingly.
- A waste container, also known as a dustbin, garbage can, and trash can is a type of container that is usually made out of metal or plastic.
- Automatic open-close lid for ease of use
- There is no contact touch between dustbin and Person so, prevention from germs and diseases.
## 4W's and 1'H
-  Smart Dustbin using Atmega328, Ultrasonic Sensor and Servo Motor, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open itself upon detection of human hand.
-  The Smart Bin is ideal for busy locations such as campuses, theme parks, airports, railway stations, and shopping malls.
-   This project makes an the benefits for the people.
-   In the present days, dustbins placed at public places , it causes some diseases. To avoid overflow, smart dustbins can be used.
- The Ultrasonic Sensor is placed on top of the dustbinâ€™s lid and when the sensor detects any object like a human hand, it will trigger Arduino to open the lid.
## SWOT Analysis
- To design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and also eco friendly. Nowadays technologies are getting smarter day-by-day so, as to clean the environment we are designing a smart dustbin by using Atmega328. This smart dustbin management system is built on the microcontroller based system having ultrasonic sensors on the dustbin.
- It  will  help  in  bringing  evolution  by technology in term of cleanliness.
- For  social  it  will  help  toward  health  and hygiene,  for  business  for  we  try  to  make  it affordable  to many  as  many  possible. So  that normal people to rich  people can take  benefit from  it.  Believe  this  will  bring  something changes  in  term  of  cleanliness  as  well technology.
- One of the outcomes of overflowing garbage is air pollution, which causes various respiratory diseases and other adverse health effects as contaminants are absorbed from lungs into other parts of the body. The toxic substances in air contaminated by waste include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane
